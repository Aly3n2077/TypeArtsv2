# TypeArts: Art Marketplace Platform

## Project Overview

TypeArts is a web-based art marketplace platform that connects artists with collectors. The platform provides a digital space for artists to showcase and sell their artwork while providing collectors with an intuitive interface to discover, preview, and purchase art.

## Core Features

- **Artist Profiles**: Customizable profiles for artists to showcase their portfolio and biography
- **Artwork Listings**: Detailed listings for individual artwork pieces with descriptions, pricing, and categories
- **Browsing & Discovery**: Category-based and filter-based artwork discovery
- **Shopping Cart**: Full e-commerce functionality to purchase artwork
- **Secure Checkout**: Integration with Stripe for payment processing (pending API key configuration)
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Hooks for local state, TanStack Query for remote state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components
- **API Client**: TanStack Query for data fetching and mutations

### Backend
- **Server**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Custom auth system (planned for future integration with OAuth providers)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe (integration pending)

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Replit
- **Database Hosting**: Managed PostgreSQL service via Replit

## Application Architecture

### Database Schema

The database schema includes the following entities:

1. **Users**: Store user information for both artists and collectors
2. **Artworks**: Store details about each artwork
3. **Categories**: Art categories for classification
4. **Artwork Categories**: Many-to-many relationship between artworks and categories
5. **Orders**: Track purchases made by collectors
6. **Order Items**: Individual items within an order
7. **Favorites**: User's saved/favorited artworks

### API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- **User Management**:
  - `GET /api/users/:id`: Get user details
  - `POST /api/users`: Create new user
  - `PATCH /api/users/:id`: Update user information

- **Artwork Management**:
  - `GET /api/artworks`: List all artworks
  - `GET /api/artworks/featured`: Get featured artworks
  - `GET /api/artworks/new`: Get new artworks
  - `GET /api/artworks/:id`: Get artwork details
  - `GET /api/artworks/artist/:id`: Get artworks by artist
  - `GET /api/artworks/category/:id`: Get artworks by category
  - `POST /api/artworks`: Create new artwork

- **Category Management**:

- **Order Management**:
  - `POST /api/orders`: Create a new order
  - `GET /api/orders/:id`: Get order details
  - `GET /api/orders/user/:id`: Get user's orders
  - `PATCH /api/orders/:id`: Update order status

- **Payment Processing** (pending implementation):

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables:
   - Database connection details (provided automatically by Replit)
   - Stripe API keys (for payment processing)

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Configuration

The project requires the following environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (provided by Replit)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Stripe secret key (for server-side operations)
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`: Stripe publishable key (for client-side operations)

## Implementation Notes

### Authentication
The application currently uses a basic authentication system with localStorage for persistence. Future iterations will implement more secure methods like JWT or OAuth.

### State Management
- **Local State**: React's useState and useEffect hooks
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for fetching and caching API data
- **Form State**: react-hook-form with zod validation

### Payment Processing
Stripe integration is configured but awaiting API keys for full functionality. The checkout process is implemented with placeholder functions until API keys are provided.

## Future Enhancements

### AR Preview Functionality
A future enhancement will include AR (Augmented Reality) capabilities, allowing users to visualize artwork in their own space before purchasing.

### AI Artwork Recommendations
Machine learning algorithms will be implemented to provide personalized artwork recommendations based on browsing history and preferences.

### Social Features
Integration with social media platforms for sharing artwork and following favorite artists.
